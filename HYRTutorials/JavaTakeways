Priority Queue--------

PriorityQueue internally utilizes a binary heap, a tree-like structure where elements are arranged based on priority. The highest-priority element resides at the root, and child nodes inherit their parentâ€™s priority. This arrangement ensures that the highest-priority element is positioned at the front while the lowest is placed at the back.
